# screen-grab
Screen Grab, activity logger takes an image of all connected screen at regular intervals.

I initially started this project to help me with completing my time-sheet.

Images are saved into a folder (which needs read, write and delete access). An image.db file helps keep a list of filenames ready for the viewer.

There is a configurable history function that removes older images.
